I am a PhD candidate in the [Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience Area](https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/program-areas/cognition-and-cognitive-neuroscience.html) of the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan. I am a fellow for both the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/resources/about-grfp/l) and [International Max Planck Research School on the Life Course (LIFE)](https://www.imprs-life.mpg.de/life-program). 

In my research I aim to apply an interdisciplinary approach to studying basic and applied cognitive processes. I am broadly interested in higher level cognition and individual differences in desire to engage in critical thinking. I conducted quantatitve and qualitative research in the domains of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, STEM education, and UX research and design. My work has been funded by organizations such as the [Institute for Educational Studies (IES)](https://ies.ed.gov/aboutus/), the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://www.nsf.gov/about/), and the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih). Currently, I study how everyday people reason about scientific and statistical concepts presented in news media. I also aim to create long-lasting educational interventions to improve such scientific reasoning skills. 

I have six years of experience designing and implementing human-subject experiments, with special focus on survey methodolodies. Statistically, I use both frequentisist and Bayesian mathematical models to analyze small and large datasets.

I am actively seeking a research position in industry so that I may apply my academic expertise in survey methodologies, experimental design, and quantitative and qualitative data analysis to finding solutions for real-world problems.
